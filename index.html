            <h3 class = "titles"> About me</h3>
            <p class ="about_me"> I am currently a sophomore at Forest Hills High School.
                I am in the Carl Sagan STEM program and am focusing on Computer Programming.
                In class I learn java while after school on Wednesdays I learn javascript with code nation.
                These classes are fun and invaluable to my future. For me, ever since I first started during
                freshmen year of highschool, coding has drawn me in
                setting me down a path longing for the ability to understand it. Additionally, I am part of the Science Olympiad team, french club and key club
                at my school. Ironically, I don't even take or speak French but because one of my best friends was the President I ran for and
                became the Vice-President (opposed to what some may believe the election was completely democratic and not rigged, I got it fair and square!!).

                One things that I enjoy is pokemon. I am striving to be the best trainer that there ever was.
                Professor Oak gave me a poodle and we have gone on many adventures. Another thing that I enjoy is 
                anime. My favorite anime is Twin Star Exorcists. It is very intriguing and I am currently on my second watch 
                through.

            <p class = "Kelty">My Puppymon is named Kelty, she is a standard poodle.
                 My family adopted her from a shelter when she was 5 months old. Her favorite activity is 
                 fetch and would do it all day if she could.  Kelty is now 6 and an integral part of the family. 
                 Additionally, she is often mistaken for a teddy bear and has been said to have “people eyes”.

            </section>
           <p class = " extracurricular">As a member of the science olympiad team I have worked all year on three events of my choosing
            (see more at  <a  class = "science_olympiad" href="https://www.soinc.org/"> https://www.soinc.org</a>). These events are trajectory where we have to build a device that shoots a tennis ball 
            onto a target, flight where we have to make a balsa wood plane, and detector building where we have to 
            make a force-mass sensor (sadly my sensor does not work because I have no clue how to code in C++ but luckily I don’t 
            need to for this job). Just this weekend on January 28 we went to a competition at Columbia University where I placed 5th in 
            trajectory. It was very fun and very tiring.
